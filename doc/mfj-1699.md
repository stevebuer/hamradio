# üì° MFJ-1699 Antenna Notes

Notes on the adjustment and usage of the MFJ-1699S HF/VHF mobile antenna. 

Currently installed with a trunk-lip mount on a Nissan Versa.

Below is a table of antenna length settings from the manual and my measured lengths after SWR tuning. 

The length of the lower portion of the radiator is: 10.25"
