# Consult the User Guide for more details on configuration options.
#
#
# These are the most likely settings you might change:
#
#	(1)   	MYCALL 	-  call sign and SSID for your station.
#
#			Look for lines starting with MYCALL and 
#			change NOCALL to your own.
#
#	(2)	PBEACON	-  enable position beaconing.
#
#			Look for lines starting with PBEACON and 
#			modify for your call, location, etc.
#
#	(3)	DIGIPEATER  -  configure digipeating rules.
#
#			Look for lines starting with DIGIPEATER.
#			Most people will probably use the given example.
#			Just remove the "#" from the start of the line
#			to enable it.
#
#	(4)	IGSERVER, IGLOGIN  - IGate server and login
#
#			Configure an IGate client to relay messages between 
#			radio and internet servers.
#
#
# The default location is "direwolf.conf" in the current working directory.
# On Linux, the user's home directory will also be searched.
# An alternate configuration file location can be specified with the "-c" command line option.  
#
# As you probably guessed by now, # indicates a comment line.
#
# Remove the # at the beginning of a line if you want to use a sample
# configuration that is currently commented out.
#
# Commands are a keyword followed by parameters.
#
# Command key words are case insensitive.  i.e. upper and lower case are equivalent.
#
# Command parameters are generally case sensitive.  i.e. upper and lower case are different.

#
# Linux ALSA is complicated.  See User Guide for discussion.
# To use something other than the default, generally use plughw

#
# Station identifier for this channel.
# Multiple channels can have the same or different names.
#
# It can be up to 6 letters and digits with an optional ssid.
# The APRS specification requires that it be upper case.

# Example (don't use this unless you are me):  MYCALL	WB2OSZ-5
#

MYCALL N7MKO-15

#
# Pick a suitable modem speed based on your situation.
#	1200 	Most common for VHF/UHF.  Default if not specified.
#	300	Low speed for HF SSB.
#	9600	High speed - Can't use Microphone and Speaker connections.
#
# In the simplest form, just specify the speed.

# On HF SSB, you might want to use multiple demodulators on slightly different
# frequencies to compensate for stations off frequency.  Here we have 7 different
# demodulators at 30 Hz intervals.  This takes a lot of CPU power so you will 
# probably need to reduce the audio sampling rate with the /n option.

# If not using a VOX circuit, the transmitter Push to Talk (PTT) 
# control is usually wired to a serial port with a suitable interface circuit.  
# DON'T connect it directly!
#
# For the PTT command, specify the device and either RTS or DTR.
# RTS or DTR may be preceded by "-" to invert the signal.
# Both can be used for interfaces that want them driven with opposite polarity.
#
# COM1 can be used instead of /dev/ttyS0, COM2 for /dev/ttyS1, and so on.
#

#PTT COM1 RTS
#PTT COM1 RTS -DTR
#PTT /dev/ttyUSB0 RTS

#
# On Linux, you can also use general purpose I/O pins if
# your system is configured for user access to them. 
# This would apply mostly to microprocessor boards, not a regular PC.
# See separate Raspberry Pi document for more details.
# The number may be preceded by "-" to invert the signal.

# The Data Carrier Detect (DCD) signal can be sent to the same places
# as the PTT signal.  This could be used to light up an LED like a normal TNC.
